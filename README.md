# Cakebrew

The Homebrew GUI App for OS X

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brunophilipe/Cakebrew.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brunophilipe/Cakebrew)

## About

Cakebrew does for [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) what Synaptics does to Linux package managers. With Cakebrew you can search, install, uninstall and update formulae and the Homebrew repository, all from within the app.

Do you need to use Homebrew but are afraid to use the terminal? Cakebrew is the app for you!

Cakebrew was based on a project by [vincentsaluzzo](https://github.com/vincentsaluzzo/Homebrew-GUI). Although most of the original project has already been modified, his project was the kickstart for what would become Cakebrew, and his commits are still in the working tree.
