# Cakebrew

The Homebrew GUI App for OS X

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brunophilipe/Cakebrew.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/brunophilipe/Cakebrew)

## About

Cakebrew is the most convenient way to use Homebrew for your daily tasks! It does for [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) what Synaptics does to Linux package managers. From the Cakebrew UI, you can:

* Search for formulae
* Install, uninstall and upgrade formulae
* Tap and untap repos
* Update Homebrew
* Run the brew cleanup tool

Cakebrew was based on a project by [vincentsaluzzo](https://github.com/vincentsaluzzo/Homebrew-GUI). Although most of the original code has already been modified, his project was the kickstart for what would become Cakebrew, and his commits are still in the working tree.
